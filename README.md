This is a project I created as part of the Insight Data Science program.

The website was at www.CandidateSummary.com, however is no longer up.  Among other things, the API I used to pull current candidates by zip code during the election season is no longer functional.

The idea for the project was to create a summary of the public statements made by each political candidate for the 2014 Congressional election.  I aggregated public statements from VoteSmart.org and used natural language processing to extract common phrases and representative quotes for each candidate.  The analysis was done using the python NLTK and Sumy packages.  I also used Gensim to explore features of the documents.
